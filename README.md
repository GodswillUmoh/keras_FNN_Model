# keras_FNN_Model
This project uses a feedforward neural network (FNN) to classify iris flowers based on petal and sepal measurements. It's a great beginner-friendly example for working with tabular data.

## About The Dataset
> The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, categorized into 3 species:
+ Setosa
+ Versicolor
+ Virginica

> Each flower has 4 features:
+ Sepal Length
+ Sepal Width
+ Petal Length
+ Petal Width
